a long i really thought newest thor installment was called thor rigmarole honestly seemed a pretty cool title rigamarole a film full shenanigans beautiful fighting crime maybe a few oneliners gratuitous supermasculine shirtless scenes rigmarole a big fuss over nothing is honestly i’d expect thor’s golden stringy locks upon closer inspection i later realized title was ragnarok sounded a garage emo rock band 2007 sure — thor off 
i saw ragnarok specifically i saw tessa thompson ragnarok tessa is valkyrie relation tom cruise movie a warrior goddess downswing current gig is capturing potential players grandmaster’s jeff goldblum gladiatorial contest better days was a defender asgard thor’s home planet are songs perfectly describe it’s watch tessa thompson valkyrie thor ragnarok “independent woman part 1” destiny’s child “these words” natasha bedingfield inarguably perfect tunes tessa’s performance is euphoric emboldening please press play duration essay 
tessa’s got comedic timing match taika waititi’s thor humor physicality lead movie’s pack superheroes she’s trying outdo boys she’s trying sip drink mind own business is whole 2017 mood consider slate gold armor looks was part beyoncé’s i am … world tour an added lapis cape michelle obama — human most perfect biceps american history — pull off valkyrie’s sleeveless armor opening scenes dares cross i she’s decidedly a sleek spandex jumpsuit a leotard you’re supposed strength admire muscles considering misogynoir launched serena williams simone biles embracing muscles physicality beautiful visual feels especially important every valkyrie took sword ready slice through evil hela’s cate blanchett minions i was rapt attention throwing popcorn toward face missing mouth soon i realized marvel stuff is hela tight 
i’ve seen black women superheroes before halle berry storm beyoncé storm i had fun during wonder woman entertained fantasies escaping themyscira everyone else tessa thompson’s valkyrie performance genuinely seemed a preview a feminist blockbuster without a bodyinvasion climax a romantic arc there’s certainly space latter valkyrie is bisexual is important mainstream representation explicit reference sexuality script was cut movie’s final edit valkyrie usurps every meme’d comicbook movie stereotype she’s white blonde named chris valkyrie is afrolatina irritable a warrior goddess valkyrie was de facto black doll childhood instead addy black slaveryera american girl doll shade addy course — love wherever are auntie’s attic — i might felt a little confident a little sure during primary school showandtell black girls didn’t always twice good always enduring kind domestic tragedy 
valkyrie has best character entrance side armie hammer call name she’s wasted drunkenly stumbling spacecraft rescue chris hemsworth has been trapped bound a group masked scavengers he’s damsel distress valkyrie boots spacecraft’s machine guns shoo away captors flips usual gendered convention head valkyrie doesn’t rescue thor she’s lonely win over goodness heart thor is big muscly a perfect contender grandmaster’s game squeeze money capture herself 
watching tessa thompson ragnarok was an exercise reclaiming hours ten whole minutes was devoted fully glorious machinations valkyrie delivers blair waldorf–level eye rolls thor tries enlist help escape back asgard eventually does trio — thor bruce banner valkyrie — steals grandmaster’s ships a break that’s valkyrie springs action using guns spacecraft zap guards trying stop leaving planet is where suddenly i marvel stans are gassed valkyrie jumps spaceship spaceship she’s leapfrogging across lily pads it’s a stunning image that’s outdone climactic battle against blanchett tessa’s glowing human manifestation fenty beauty’s trophy wife 
inner workings marvel cinematic universe remain a mystery i clicked enough abe riesman explainers exists thompson show a future avengers movie she’s rumored returning infinity war was spotted movie’s edinburgh set might i request a good marvel actresses already floated idea an allladies avengersstyle ensemble i vote keep valkyrie avengers posse 120 minutes a valkyrie standalone a boozy adventure midair fights explosions maybe a mink cape a color worthy nickelodeon’s kids’ choice awards that’d really cool imagine valkyrie kicking ass striding off dive bar asgard a pint insecure meets wonder woman meets waiting exhale ticket is already purchased

set 2002 lady bird allows brief glimmers post 911 world order break through hermetic seal christine’s senior mostly through tv news broadcasts inevitable mentions terrorism anytime christine mentions york city — where yearns college doesn’t work she’ll settle somewhere comparably cosmopolitan “like connecticut hampshire” gerwig has called lady bird a love letter sacramento where grew bathes city a golden predusk light — a testament mixed feelings us places made us towns realize love it’s leave 
christine is a senior immaculate heart “immaculate fart” scoffs a face full freckles shoulderlength brown hair dyed a fading pink ronan’s performance ranges poignant sidesplitting is weighted a real regard anguish teenage life — she’s funny precisely lady bird herself takes being lady bird seriously high school drama lady bird may seem trivial surface tragedy made comedy distance a decade gerwig treats young subjects complex human beings cliched broody teens 
although gerwig herself doesn’t appear giddy energy infuses both film character a nun immaculate heart a delightful lois smith tells christine has a “performative streak” that’s an understatement christine is ever committed role whatever is you’re 17 change overnight spots crushes danny an adorable lucas hedges grocery store family sidles delivers a line a femme fatale a noir “come often” later crushing a boy timothee chalamet plays a band reads howard zinn while smoking cigarettes steps role cool girl blowing off school play hang a parking lot inexplicably nicknamed “the deuce”

movie is keenly attuned subtleties american class christine loves she’s “from wrong side tracks” is literally mother marion played wonderful laurie metcalf takes shopping thrift store cheer daughter marion suggests “our favorite sunday activity” — checking fancy open houses father larry tracy letts is good cop marion’s bad cop he’s struggling a quieter depression after losing job 
although lady bird maintains focus ronan’s character it’s ways marion’s story too offering an insightful portrait an intimate yet contentious motherdaughter relationship gerwig nails dynamic subtle manner marion’s little criticisms small sharp a pin poke a daughter’s psyche a mother weeks worth argument hostility drift off mist a shopping excursion mother daughter both spot right dress same 
lady bird moves fast zippy bubbly without sacrificing emotional weight a decade movies has given gerwig a natural instinct end a scene often immediately after a punchline cut becoming part punchline short brusque scenes bumping abruptly each vignettes teenage life sometimes build bigger plot points sometimes stand own — broke arm got a pink cast scribbled “fuck mom” healed was never happened 
lady bird is a rare bird sentimental without being saccharine emotional without being contrived able conjure tears without yanking heartstrings while music swells matteroffactness is makes film ultimately wrenching there’s great tragedy great uplift life it’s actually lived moments are 
text three billboards establishes a narrative although that’s starting point martin mcdonagh’s stellar three billboards outside ebbing missouri doesn’t hint film’s eventual trajectory takes viewer a dizzying ride through dark comedy wrenching tragedy shocking moments karmic twists redemption thus far 2017 hasn’t offered anything close experience provided movie effectively traverses a high wire between comedy tragedy does without a safety net outside coen brothers it’s hard a filmmaker skill production mcdonagh has placed himself august company 
bruges put mcdonagh map seven psychopaths although uneven was dismissed lightly three billboards however has exceeded expectations mcdonagh hasn’t gotten better has rocketed stratosphere having won people’s choice award toronto been nominated 11 british independent film awards it’s hard believe three billboards isn’t a fast track kind oscar recognition

salient differences between a great movie is “merely” good is deeply movie implants itself memory are thinking an hour after finishes a a week impressions are often good indicators a film’s power sometimes takes thoughts a marinate three billboards lingers richness complexity characters choices mcdonagh makes bringing story screen approach is specific uncompromising it’s safe approached lesser actors a wavering confidence result been deemed an “interesting failure” there’s a whiff failure movie best certainly conversation

gerwig persona we’ve acting — awkward affable endearing — is every frame movie much brain might visualize gerwig rather ronan playing a particular scene sense authorship though is makes movie ring true “lady bird” feels a grown woman’s letter furious younger self says nothing is awful everything is ok someday we’ll back laugh

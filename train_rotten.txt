second season “entourage” aired 2005 is largely concerned question whether vincent chase adrian grenier should star an aquaman movie written “seven” scribe andrew kevin walker directed james cameron vince is concerned it’s a corporate compromise he’ll end “on a 70foot screen looking an underwater elton john” studio executive dana gordon constance zimmer insists “aquaman” “a darker grittier movie” a 100 million budget vince’s agent ari gold jeremy piven is enamored prospect an escalating payday 5 million installment a franchise 7 million second 12 million a possible third once vince agrees friends navigate confusing environs san diego comiccon set cameron playing himself kids vincent’s manager eric kevin connolly five years won’t need actors movies 
twelve years later an aquaman movie least a movie aquaman — dc’s “justice league” arrives theaters after own series misadventures superhero movie industry has outstripped grandiose vision “entourage” laid budget “justice league” reportedly climbed 300 million after extensive reshoots marvel franchise has made robert downey jr plays tony stark most highly compensated actors hollywood salary individual marvel movies has climbed tens millions dollars directors haven’t entirely abandoned real actors are increasingly able create shots digitally it’s hard imagine any promising young actor balk making a superhero movie everyone benedict cumberbatch michael b jordan brie larson scrambling supersuits 
“justice league” is a symbol entrenched superhero movies become hollywood ecosystem it’s a potent illustration success hasn’t necessarily artistically elevated genre it’s beat beat “justice league” feels nearly identical superhero movies before features ugliest most pointless special effects i’ve seen movies a long it’s darn feels depressingly haphazard thoughtless it’s guaranteed a ton money anyway superhero fans are a ridiculously powerful market deserve better 
it’s worth noting weird mishmash is “justice league” probably reflects circumstances creation zack snyder film’s original director stepped away project earlier after daughter committed suicide joss whedon directed “the avengers” “avengers age ultron” marvel stepped reshoot finalize movie men’s styles little complement each snyder tends grim gritty while whedon has a sunny streak both emotionally visually releasing “justice league” form dc did does a service neither 
given distinct visions feels relatively easy discern “justice league” comes snyder — ponderous plot almost entirely incoherent action sequences — comes whedon — jokes lightening dc cinematic universe isn’t worst idea world though might been wise literally cut through visual gloom has a tendency render action sequences muddy exception flash a delightful ezra miller best parts movie jokes don’t necessarily feel grounded individual characters nor much deepen relationships between superhero team is aquaman jason momoa a bro an ecologist an exile never quite figure where whedon used humor break tension “avengers” movies relationship between stakes carnage “justice league” jokes characters midst doesn’t feel calibrated quite right 
a similar muddiness applies dynamic team itself batman ben affleck is driven a sense obligation city gotham remorse over death superman henry cavill wonder woman gal gadot whose face miller’s continues franchise’s best special effects is taking place world after years seclusion cyborg ray fisher is furious experiments father joe morton performed save life after mother was killed an explosion afraid experimental technology is keeping alive seems evolving flash is singleminded determination free father billy crudup prison aquaman appears mostly signed figure batman actually runs around dressed a bat 
motivations potentially lead dramatically productive tensions prickliness between iron captain america chris evans unusually sympathetic pairings dynamic between hulk mark ruffalo black widow scarlett johansson “justice league” is introducing three characters foregoing slower burn origin story movies leading a teamup it’s simply too full actually space relationships unfold “justice league” is constantly cutting location next without necessarily stringing scenes together a advances theme creates intriguing juxtapositions moment next 
threads comes through is banal — cyborg flash are both lonely — another infuriating after success “wonder woman” summer it’s maddening “justice league” suggest both lois lane amy adams wasted wonder woman are somehow doing enough fight evil grief batman literally set motion events led superman’s death “batman v superman dawn justice” is last person should lecturing wonder woman score are 
writing a piece is sort a depressing enterprise sometimes reviewing superhero movies makes feel a lawyer filing a brief behalf a client doesn’t really representation love dc movies aren’t going a decision seeing “justice league” based sayso warner bros’ isn’t going suddenly light i didn’t that’s fine fact it’s probably should everyone involved making “justice league” everyone eventually deserved something better most dominant genre movies shouldn’t muddled — timid 
justice league latest iptocash conversion scheme warner bros dc comics seems hate predecessor almost much rest us did last year’s batman v superman dawn justice was grim title was ungainly justice league actually attempts jokes film was nihilistic protagonists beefed each particular reason strains hopeful unlikely compatriots uniting a greater good movie despite promised têteàtête was weighted down extraneous flashbacks clunky exposition inscrutable teases future films … muddles through a lot flashbacks exposition marginally less inscrutable teases did expect strength superman couldn’t turn ship around 
film brings together most iconic comicbook superheroes justice league ought left fans studio execs feeling giddier lex luthor death ray instead thanks batman v superman’s poor reception reports extensive reshoots continued employment ben affleck batman there’s really been reason forward sequel wonder woman gal gadot whose solo film earlier was a hit both critics box office whose thrilling disarming treatment source material suggested deadly serious dc extended universe might able locate panache heart that’s tried bringing buffy vampire slayer creator avengers director joss whedon late process scriptdoctor already filmed movie after director zack snyder stepped back production amid personal tragedy over director reshoots thought dc’s movies a

while don’t quite oversaw justice league feel men’s sensibilities gnawing is a world where superman henry cavill has died killed last film ohwhocaresatthispoint an opening sequence tries play things both operatically—lots civilians shuffling slowmotion misery—and playfully glimpse a newspaper front page containing pictures superman prince david bowie headline “did return planet” it’s prophetic justice league can’t quite shake crudely philosophical bulgingmuscles melodrama snyder 300 watchmen became an alist director wouldn’t mind injecting pizzazz a good tony stark–bruce banner banter session too often approaches collide same scene 
i doubt villainous darkseid himself devise a torture device punishing hour justice league front half batman v superman is almost entirely setup a tangle vignettes backstory involving an imminent threat batman is tracking an invasion force buglike “parademons” heroes varying degrees interest joining fray ray fisher’s cyborg ezra miller’s flash jason momoa’s aquaman a triplemacguffin plot involves mysterious doomsday cubes an ancient battle between gods amazons atlanteans men strands emerge rapidly yet elliptically shrouding is actually a simple story a “new god” named steppenwolf ciarán hinds wants turn earth a hellacious tribute fellow cosmic deities needs three “mother boxes” means it’s batman wonder woman pals since bvs call top prospects 
point team finally teams and—to immense surprise—the film least spurts becomes kind fun gadot’s wonder woman is same driven asskicking nametaking outsider was solo film she’s pushing others—like tragic reticent cyborg—to own superresponsibilities momoa plays aquaman a cowboy taking third ride a mechanical bull a happy browarrior is team’s loose cannon miller’s flash might greatest joy plays speedster a neurotic inexperienced oddball meets batman tries explain costume “oh i competitive ice dancing” there’s a decent gag involving universal truth brunch is useless speaking batman affleck has lightened while arc wonder woman doesn’t quite land least he’s unpleasant around last grimaced superman asked “do bleed” he’s longer cribbing dialogue a video game issuing an intentional echo takes a hard fall “something’s definitely bleeding” less said steppenwolf—who has face an extrapruney emperor palpatine cardboardvillain lines such “you scream”—the better 
it’s principals made a course correction course is still snyder’s signature action style involving debrisflecked set pieces lots lots timeline ramping speed gets brainmeltingly slow better us witness carnage technique comes a ribbing flash races beneath a plummeting wonder woman poke back direction sword is trying catch justice league is aware director’s tics sometimes manages leaven are a lot tics overcome 
i realize i am allowing film slide under a low bar better marvel films shown need a lot zippy repartee a superhero film feel heartfelt thematically resonant despite whedony patches is mostly a sensesassaulting mess an offense good taste basic narrative cohesion scene batman asks butler alfred jeremy irons where team has arrived an island between metropolis gotham discussed literally scene earlier later batman radio alfred a locale film has taken pains identify a communications dead zone plot holes are most obvious signs movie’s troubled origins they’re rather small compared abyss separates movie’s divergent tones 
is clear brains behind dc extended universe realized pummeling ponderous approach zack snyder comicbook influences mines—chiefly brooding ’80s works frank miller alan moore—will longer certainly did nothing help last year’s suicide squad worst dc film while wonder woman entrusted character a director’s original vision great reward justice league is a quarter measure an attempt square grimness goofiness long are least a dozen films coming it’d nice next aquaman 2018 wonder woman 2019 cyborg 2020 return save universe it’s we’d actually spend 
technology is any power” gal gadot’s wonder woman says latest least superhero teamup “without reason without heart destroys us” apparently dc didn’t memo “justice league” is a pointless flail expensive yet somehow cheaplooking cgi amount tackedon quips gadot’s luminescent star power rescue 
cyborg ray fisher ostensible heroes “justice league” is patched together disparate elements original director zack snyder “batman v superman” left partway through due a death family leaving joss whedon “the avengers” finish result plodding gray generic action a snyder film stabs whedonian humor almost never feel organic there’s sense purpose a sense place

anyway — spoilers “bvs” — earth’s beloved defender superman henry cavill is dead bruce is rounding superpowerendowed peeps he’s been creepily surveilling richguy tech toys movie careens character’s intro another regard either exposition transition genuinely often feels there’s nobody helm maybe a bot randomly deploying comicbook tropes 
pity actors signed thinking a lark “the avengers” whedon’s goodnatured 2012 marvel pic jason momoa been maybe yet fab reinventing silliest superheroes aquaman a strutting neptunian wildman he’s a fishman water reduced yelling “wahoo” carsurfs batmobile fisher’s cyborg sole black character allwhite team appears face obscured a hoodie really screen consists almost entirely droning ability synch computers bazinga

exception is ezra miller ”fantastic beasts where them” flash manages least mischievous good cheer radiates humanness where most actors perplexingly madam tussaud’s renditions themselves each tableau strutting posing league sadly there’s count miller a little sideeye breaking fourth wall implore us a little fun 
flash can’t outrun sucking maw unambitious movie concludes a postcredits scene assuring us there’ll a sequel anyway truly is justice

last “boo a madea halloween” madea tyler perry elderly cohorts aunt bam cassi davis hattie patrice lovely joe tyler perry matched wits a bunch trifling frat boys disrespectful high school senior girls were trying crash frat’s halloween party trailer promised comic scares movie provided none tipped hand early let us supernatural happenings were pranks madea’s crew madea got revenge trapping frat boys a prison bus big burly prisoners itching sexually assault was moralizing somewhere too is par course tyler perry land 
humble reviewer covered prior film biggest problem was i had sincerely hoped madea match wits actual monsters killers horror movies after broad comedy horror yield entertaining features “abbott costello meet frankenstein” madea were right she’d scold i should “careful i wish fuhrrr” creator has blessed us “tyler perry’s boo 2 a madea halloween” adds blatant horror elements mix it’s possible guy chasing joe a chainsaw might actually butcher 
i’m getting ahead myself i should address is damn title “tyler perry’s boo 2 a madea halloween” is unwieldy it’s such a missed opportunity i mr perry has seen “breakin’ 2 electric boogaloo” film contains greatest subtitle every slapped a movie had named film “boo 2 electric boogaloo” i given four stars sight unseen perry’s problems sequel titles goes back “why did i married too” may kvetching a title is a petty affair difference between box office success failure ask “the hudsucker proxy” 
course madea doesn’t worry bad box office has a builtin audience faithful faithfilled pack seats opening weekend sit through 104 minutes “boo 2” once demanding perry present something innovative that’s problem is madea’s tenth appearance films matter topic exists a cinematic universe filled numerous scenes sitting arguing a room granted scenes amusing you’d expect visual potency a has 45 directorial credits imdb don’t wrong nobody is expecting citizen kane hurt film presentable 
i digress you’re going madea’s house laugh forget troubles perhaps a good christian message perry’s credit does a far better job folding message film usual before however must contend once again madea’s niece tiffany diamond white “boo 1” wants attend a halloween frat party gets permission mother debrah taja v simpson tiffany is 18 should trusted father brian tyler perry allows tiffany walks over brian he’s such a wimp it’s solely grace god tiffany isn’t juvie hall murder brian is outoftouch has a petting zoo tiffany’s 18th birthday party 
events film caused a moratorium frat house parties frat decides shindig camp crystal lake whatever perry calls haunted vista “friday 13th” sexobsessed camp counselors were butchered camp leading rumors may haunted serial killers may still reside it’s perfect spot a scary party n’estce pas tiffany can’t wait fool around frat brothers old enough father bros is supposed 20 has a thick full beard i can’t grow 47 
madea gets wind tiffany is using debrah defy brian’s order skip party crew spring action unfortunately madea—and partygoers—something spooky awaits soon camp encounter a batch ghouls murder mind there’s a guy a gas mask a chainsaw another guy an ax hairy little girl “the ring” unlike last killers are definitely fraternity pranksters appear supernatural powers victims can’t outrun leave behind bloodstains 
i liked perry took inspiration murderers’ attire 80’s slasher films “the prowler” i liked final reveal killers’ identities made little sense did slashers “boo 2” benefited better scenes stalkandescape are treated several mildly amusing moments madea crew reacting fright whatever befalls since don’t level terrors are “boo 2” comes off halloweenworthy predecessor yet madea finally decides “kick ass” movie deprives us wonderful might been 
perry’s best scene madea is funniest films while a police station report creepy goingson madea notices has a wanted poster wall looks “madea goes jail” madea tries act inconspicuous draw attention can’t help giddy reputation giggles a schoolgirl over youthful picture used hattie points madea is wanted check fraud madea draws attention litany crimes she’s wanted poster i laughed loud before i realized scene is tyler perry universe microcosm movies a lot money are cheap easy madea perry’s getting away attempted murder i can’t knock hustle i pray i’m living a fool’s paradise hoping he’ll kind masterpiece show us critics wrong we’ve been

campy silliness

a bigticket genre film comes within a couple weeks already a knockoff featuring cutrate special effects an utterly insane storyline blevel actors are lucky traipsing through silliness exchange a quick paycheck “geostorm” feels 120 million according studio version such a film—the effects may somewhat better stuff syfy network producers over might blanched nonsense offered mention major problems run risk turning review a mere list i highlight a couple starters hero is a loud obnoxious jerk few spend any amount i fear butler embodies characteristic a t—you spend half movie hoping film is going pull an “executive decision” knock early real actually likable hero save conspiracy angle doesn’t work a elaborate plot doesn’t any sense dumb action film standards b bad guy is patently obvious most able figure looking credits poster oh yeah are any number extraneous subplots—jake’s relationship disappointed moppet a daughter max’s supposedly clandestine affair a secret service agent abbie cornish actually act whose presence is disappointing a result—that nothing eat screen linger over meal length boot
